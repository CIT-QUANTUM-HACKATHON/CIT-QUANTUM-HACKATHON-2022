Hallo Leute!

We take immense pleasure in organizing the CIT QUANTUM HACKATHON 2022 as part of the Qiskit Fall Fest sponsered by IBM Quantum - Qiskit.

Niels Bohr was right in saying that “If Quantum mechanics hasn’t profoundly shocked you, you haven’t understood it yet”. Are you ready to get shocked with us at our gracious event? Most people think they need to have vast knowledge to win an international event when they actually need to begin with a small idea. 

Let's do this guys! 

Get in -> share your thoughts -> enhance it and seize the prize in our CIT Quantum Hackathon that plays a part in the Qiskit Fall Fest Event sponsored by IBM Quantum for the second time. Get into this hackathon and multiply your skills in Quantum Computing by doing projects using Qiskit, the open-source quantum computing SDK built on Python.

Our hackathon is exclusively for the high school  and college students in and around COIMBATORE. Don't sweat it guys, we are here as a helping-hand with loads of  mentors and volunteers who will make this event a piece of cake for you. Just dive into it and embrace our event.

We are here with more exciting updates, kindly stick around. We are looking forward to your presence in our event!
